> /file:save @performance-bottlenecks-testing.md

# 4. Merge performance testing components into comprehensive strategy
> /file:merge @performance-test-coverage.md @performance-test-quality.md @performance-bottlenecks-testing.md into @performance-testing-strategy.md, then delete the source files that were merged
```

### Test-Driven Development Support
```
qwen
```

```qwen
# 1. Analyze current testing practices and coverage
> /test:coverage
> /file:save @current-testing-practices.md

# 2. Create TDD-focused development plan
> /create:tdd based on current test coverage analysis and improvement needs
> /file:save @tdd-development-plan.md

# 3. Review test structure for TDD compliance
> /test:review-and-correct focusing on test structure, organization, and TDD best practices
> /file:save @tdd-compliance-review.md

# 4. Merge TDD components into comprehensive implementation plan
> /file:merge @current-testing-practices.md @tdd-development-plan.md @tdd-compliance-review.md into @tdd-implementation-plan.md, then delete the source files that were merged
