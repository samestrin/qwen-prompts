## Arguments

- `filename`: **Required** - The filename (with extension) to save the previous response content to, prefixed with `@`

## Security Considerations

> **Note:** This command saves conversation content to files on your local system. Ensure that sensitive information in saved responses is handled appropriately according to your security requirements.

The file saving process:
- Retrieves the previous response content from conversation history
- Writes content directly to the specified filename
- Supports various file formats (markdown, text, code files)
- Supports date and time placeholders in filenames
- Provides confirmation of successful save operation
- Handles file path creation and error management
