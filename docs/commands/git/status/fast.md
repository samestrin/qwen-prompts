# /git:status:fast

## Overview

The `/git:status:fast` command provides a quick Git repository status check with minimal processing. This fast version runs `git status` and immediately stops without analysis, recommendations, or additional processing, making it ideal for rapid status checks during development workflows.

## Usage Examples

## Security Considerations

> **Note:** This command only reads repository status and makes no changes to your Git repository.

The fast status process:
- Runs `git status` to get current repository state
- Shows staged changes, unstaged changes, and untracked files
- Displays current branch and tracking information
- Provides immediate output without analysis or recommendations
- Safe read-only operation with no repository modifications
