# /git:pull - Safe Remote Repository Synchronization

## Overview

Safely pulls changes from remote repositories following best practices and coding standards. This command validates pull operations, checks for conflicts, applies appropriate merge strategies, and provides comprehensive conflict resolution guidance while maintaining project quality standards.

## Usage Examples

### Pull current branch from upstream
```qwen
/git:pull
```

### Pull with rebase for cleaner history
```qwen
/git:pull --rebase
```

### Pull specific branch from origin
```qwen
/git:pull origin main
```

### Safe pull (fast-forward only)
```qwen
/git:pull --ff-only
```

## Arguments

- `remote`: **Optional** - Remote repository name to pull from
- `branch`: **Optional** - Specific branch to pull
- `--rebase`: **Optional** - Use rebase strategy instead of merge
- `--ff-only`: **Optional** - Only allow fast-forward pulls (safest option)
- Additional Git pull options as supported by the git pull command



## Security Considerations

> **Note:** Pull operations integrate external code into your local repository. This command implements security measures to ensure safe integration:
> - **Remote Validation:** Verifies remote repository authenticity and access permissions
> - **Change Analysis:** Reviews incoming changes for potential security implications
> - **Conflict Resolution:** Provides secure guidance for resolving merge conflicts
> - **Standards Compliance:** Ensures pulled changes align with project security standards
